# Who am I?
My name is Eric Masson and...

- I am the proud father of four and grand dad of two already :)
- Canadian living in Montreal
- Started programming on a Commodore VIC-20(in 1980) and never looked back. Learned 6502 as Basic was too limited for graphic and extended it to a whooping 32Kb
- I love American muscle car. I am a big Mustang fan and consider myself a gear head
- I was lucky enough to travel the world and work overseas for more than 10 years
- I speak several languages and love Asian cultures
- I am passionate about space exploration, astrophysics, mysteries of the Universe and slowly diving into Quantum computing
- I love electronic music to the point of making my own and djing in clubs and after-hours. Visit my Soundcloud page at: soundcloud.com/ameza
- I had the privilege to work with SGI and helped many companies with their interactive computer graphic technologies and high performance computing challenges
- My love and passion for SGI and 3D started with Daniel Langlois's SoftImage, and the rest is history.
- I love anything 3D/VR/AR/MR related and I still enjoy doing 3D modelling with Blender and writing cool stuff on the Unity platform.

# MaXX Interactive Desktop

I am the creator and author of the MaXX Interactive Desktop, aka the SGI Desktop on Linux.  I basically wrote and adapted existing technology to recreate the SGI Desktop on Linux.  I was given (in early 2000s) a special license from SGI that allowed me to pursue my passion and without getting in trouble with SGI's lawyers.  The license in a nutshell allows me to duplicate the entire desktop user experience, re-implement (by myself) the required SGI APIs and duplicate the SGI look and feel.

As of today, I must comply to some rules established and agreed between SGI and myself.  The desktop is currently limited to Linux (Intel) operating system, and I cannot release some of my source code in order to protect some of SGI's intellectual property.
Having said that, I wish at some point to change that and support OpenBSD and ARM based Linux distributions with of course the consent of whom controls/owns those intellectual property rights.
